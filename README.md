#Usage
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- After cloning the repo, run bundle to install dependencies.
- To migrate your local database, run 'rake db:migrate'.
- Run 'rake db:seed' to load seed data for Counselors and Activities.
- Facebook login requires a secure connection, so to start the application, run 'thin start --ssl' from the application root folder.
- In a browser, go to https://localhost:3000/ to begin.

- You can start the application (without Facebook login capabilities) by running 'rails s' from the application root folder. Then in a browser, go to http://localhost:3000/ to begin.
